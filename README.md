# PictoGram

This is an image gallery where users can submit image URLs which are then stored onto Firebase cloud storage. Firebase then returns these image URLs to the user to be displayed in a sequential order within the user interface. 

What I Used:
1. React.js
2. Firebase Storage
3. Cloud Firestore
4. Framer Motion animations
